# Preparing a presentation for a Kaggle meetup

_Obviously, several of the suggestions below are only relevant to in-person presentations. For the moment, we are doing the meetups online through Zoom. The parts to ignore should be fairly obvious._

## Choosing a competition

- Normally we choose a "real" competition that has ended
    - Learner or playground competitions are possible though
- Go to the Kaggle [competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
- Sort by _Latest deadline_ to put the most recent competitons at the top
- Scroll down until you find a competition of interest
- Check that the competition hasn't already been presented and isn't scheduled
    - check the [log of past meetups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dmunY2g2Is-S6PlfKVZy_99zbIGvVD-f4Omu_rcXrLo/edit?usp=sharing)
    - check the [pipeline of upcoming meetups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOVuiNuKMd6A5QCLNnNXCZX7UxiCL4dKv5bOq8K0gmw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Preparing the presentation

- Plan to present for **one hour**, this will allow for about 15 minutes Q&A during and after the talk
- It's good to have some extra, expendable material in case time runs short
- Check out [Bruce's blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190812205708/http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/08/09/learn-data-science-from-kaggle-competition-meetups/) of presentation tips
    - One tweak on what it says in that blog post. It says don't try to explain a complicated topic in two minutes. But what we have found is that attendees like it when you pick one specific topic that comes up in a competition (what does AUC mean? what is transposed convolution?) and spend a bit of time to explain it from scratch, for someone who's never heard of it before.
- Here's a list of [winning solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/winning-solutions-of-kaggle-competitions). Not sure how complete it is, but if your competition is there, it will be a big help
- Use a big font where possible--much of the audience is far from the screen
- Google Slides works really well
    - you can update right up to the last minute or after the presentation
    - everyone will have access to your latest updates
- **Pro tip for using Google Slides:** Install this [Chrome/Firefox extension](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/420529-slideshide).

## The day before

- Post your presentation slides, even if unfinished
    - attendees appreciate it
- Does your laptop have a _real_ HDMI output?
    - Adapters don't work well
    - If you don't have HDMI, let the organizers know and we'll figure something out

## On the day

- Bring a mouse if you've got one
    - You can use the mouse as a pseudo laser pointer
    - Works well for the audience, live stream viewers, and video recording
- Show up at least half an hour before the start (i.e., 6:00pm)
    - There are always glitches, this gives us time to fix problems
- Wear a solid color top
    - Yes, we're talking about your fashion choices
    - Why solid color? Patterns and stripes cause weird Moir√© effects in the video.
